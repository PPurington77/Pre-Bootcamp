<!-- // Problem:  -->
<!-- // A computer application needs to be able to identify if a written -->
<!-- // paragraph is written in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd person  -->

<!-- 1. Using comments write out 1 strategy that could be used to solve the problem  -->
<!-- create a program that can read the supplied paragraphs. When it comes upon certain keywords which are used to determine  -->
<!-- if it's written in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd person (I, we, they....etc) it can put them into an array -->
<!-- Once the paragraph is read and the array's are created the program will then compare the arrays against each other -->
<!-- Once the arrays are compared the program, and depending on which array is the largest the program will return the result -->

<!-- 2. Using comments create pseudo code to apply the strategy  -->
<!-- var firstarr = []
var secarr = []
var thirdarr = []
if (at each occurance of I || we ) {
    firstarr.push(count)
}
else if(at each occurance of You) {
    secarr.push(count)
}
else if(at each occurance of he || she || it || they) {
    thirdarr.push(count)
}
if (fisrtarr.length > secarr.length && thirdarr.length) {
    console.log("first person")
}
else if (secarr.length > firstarr.length && thirdarr.length) {
    console.log("second person")
}
else if (thirdarr.length > firstarr.length && secarr.length) {
    console.log("third person")

<!-- 3. write a short paragraph that answers what is the hardest part about problem solving?
In my opinion the most challenging part about problem solving is not be overly consumed in a single solution that you loose sight of the problem itself. For example:
I want to go to the store. The store is 1 mile from my house. There are many solutions to this problem such as driving, walking, running, or riding a bike. But many other 
variable's also exist, such as how much do I need to buy, and how do I transport it back. With how high gas prices are today it would make sense to walk or ride a bike
to save money. If I become overly focused on riding the bike and making sure that I can solve the potential problems like how much to buy or how to transport it back
I create a whole new set of problems. Would it not be easier to drive once, buy everything you need (trunk full) versus making multiple trips via biking or walking time wise.
So for the above provided problem I'm sure there are multiple ways to solve it in multiple different programming languages. I could be so consumed on making it work how I 
have it above that I don't think about or even entertain that there may be a better way. TLDR step back and think about the problem on a larger scale and don't be consumed
with a single solution.  -->
