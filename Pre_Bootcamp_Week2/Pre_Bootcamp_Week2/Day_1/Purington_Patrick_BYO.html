    <h2>I'm making this site so you can learn a few facts about me!</h2>
    <p>I live in Keystone Heights, Florida. It feels like summer 8 months out of the year, and sweat is your friend. I'm married, and my wife's name is Debby. We have two dogs named Ham and Cheese. We also have two cats name Turd and Heck. Our favorite hobby is traveling, and we will talk more about that later!</p>
    <p>Here's a list of some of my favorite things to do!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Watch football</li>
        <li>Watch Formula 1</li>
        <li>Travel</li>
        <li>Play with my dogs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Travel!</h2>
    <p>When we have the time we love to travel. The first country I travelled to outside of the United States was Ireland. Ireland is beautiful, and my favorite place that we visited was the Cliff's of Moher</p>
